## Exercise 1

Implement the "Person" class. Must be stored
in the class fields: full name, date of birth, contact phone number, city, country, home address. Implement Methods
class for data input, data output, implement
accessing individual fields through class methods.

### Task 1.1
To the already implemented class “Person” add
necessary constructors as well as necessary overloaded methods

## Task 2

Create a "City" class. Must be stored in class fields: city name, region name, title
countries, number of inhabitants in the city, postal code
city, telephone city code. Implement class methods for data input, data output, implement access
to individual fields through class methods.

### Task 2.1
To the already implemented “City” class, add the necessary constructors, as well as the necessary overloaded methods.

## Task 3

Create a class "Country". Must be stored in fields
class: country name, continent name, number of inhabitants in the country, country telephone code, name
capitals, names of cities in the country. Implement Methods
class for data input, data output, implement
accessing individual fields through class methods.

### Task 3.1
To the already implemented “Country” class, add the necessary constructors, as well as the necessary overloaded methods.

## Task 4

Create a "Fraction" class. Must be stored in fields
class: numerator and denominator. Implement class methods for data input, data output, implement access
to individual fields through class methods. Also create
class methods for performing arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).

### Task 4.1
To the already implemented “Fraction” class, add the necessary constructors, as well as the necessary overloaded methods.

## Task 5

Implement the Book class. It is necessary to store in the class fields: title of the book, full name of the author, year of publication,
name of the publisher, genre of the book, number of pages.
Implement class constructors and methods for input
data, data output, implement access to individual
fields through class methods. Use method overloading mechanism.

## Task 6

Implement the Car class. Must be stored
in the class fields: car name, manufacturer name, year of manufacture, engine size. Implement class constructors and methods for data input, data output,
implement access to individual fields through class methods.
Use method overloading mechanism.
